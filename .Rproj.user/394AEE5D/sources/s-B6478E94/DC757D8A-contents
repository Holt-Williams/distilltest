This article looks at the MTCARS dataset that is so often used to demostrate diffrent package capabilities. We will begin by looking at the structure of the data frame.

```{r, include=TRUE}
mtcars2<-mtcars
mtcars2$am<- as.factor(mtcars2$am)
str(mtcars2) 
```
As we can see there are 11 variables with 32 observations describing a dataset of cars. Next we will look at the graphing capability in Distill.


```{r}
mtcars2%>%ggplot(aes(hp,mpg))+geom_smooth(aes(col=am))

```


```{r}
mtcars2%>%ggplot(aes(mpg))+geom_density(aes(col=am))

```

```{r}
mtcars2%>%ggplot(aes(qsec))+geom_histogram(bins=5, aes())

```

```{r}
mtcars2%>%ggplot(aes(qsec))+geom_freqpoly(bins=5, aes(col=am))

```

The currentn articel is basic as this is a testign area to see the capabilites of Distill adn its potential uses. Check back later for updates!
