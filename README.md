This is a testing groudn of integrating distill with github pages which allows users to write articles in R which are then "knit" into HTML, pushed to git-hub, and shown on the above website.

Due to its ease of use I will also be creating a small background/resume section and the articles will consist of other small projects as a testing ground of features.
